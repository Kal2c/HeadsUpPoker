Functional version of the app has been uploaded, I appreciate the readability of App.py far from acceptable right now. I am having issues when adding the decision tree function

to a new file and passing the hand to them that ruin the funcitonality of the app. I am currently on holiday, will fix this issue when I am back (~2 weeks time).

Additional functionality is also planned, refer to 'Projects' section on my GitHub.
